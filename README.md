# Hangman

### The Classic Game of Hangman

___

#### Project Description

This project aims to replicate the word guessing game "hangman" in your terminal from a list of predetermined words. During this project I have prioritised good coding practices to make the code easy to follow and operate smoothly with error handling applied to all user inputs.

In future there may be amendments to the code so that an external word list can be imported and used to play the game. If so this will need to be stored in the same location as the executable game file.

In future the user may be able to select a game difficulty which changes the number of incorrect guesses allowed. Possibly also modify proportional to the number of characters in the chosen word.

___

#### How to install and run

To run this game simply download the executable file to your local machine. Open the file and the game will run locally in your terminal

**consider installation packages**

___

Instructions and tips to play the game are included as you go. However, a step by step guidline with screenshots are included to see how a successful or unsuccesful game would look below.
